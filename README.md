Lite Scrum saves you time doing your daily tasks. An example of a task would be :
"Go to grocery store" or "Add combo box for style preference selection for users on my site". 
Lite Scrum is not only for programmers, developers, and teams.It can be used by a single person,individually and also by a team.

</p>
<p>
  <br>
  To run the application, you need first to:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a database (SQL)</li>
    <li>Copy paste code of CREATE_ALL_TABLES_SCRUM_DB.sql file into Sql Server Management Studio. Please remember to change the database name to your own. This file uses SCRUM database name. You can create your own and change all the statements of USE [SCRUM] to USE [your own database name]</li>
    <li>Open solution in Visual Studio ( WebApplication4 folder ) or host it in IIS of your choice or cloud. But first change the web.config database connection to your own created above:</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <br>
  This is the connectionstring in web.config that you need to change.The only things you need to change are:
  <ul>
  <li>
    YOURDATASOURCE (which is the address of your SQL server ex: LOCALDB\LocalUser or SQLServer112233.someserver.com) 
  </li>
    <li>
    YOURSQLDATABASE (The name of SQL database you created in previous step. Mine for example I called it SCRUM) 
  </li>
    <li>
    YOURSQLDATABASEUSERID (The user ID that you use to log in to your instance of SQL Server)
  </li>
    <li>
      YOURSQLDATABASEPASSWORD  (The password that you use to log in to your instance of SQL Server )
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  ex:<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/cs.png" alt="webconfig"/>
</p>
<br>

Also, in the same WebConfig, you need to change your SMTP settings, if you want to keep the SMTP functionality. 
It is mainly used to send email to reset password and registration confirmation.<br>
<br>
So to change the SMTP server of your choice, in the same web.config please find the appSettings section:<br>
<img src="/Images/as.png" alt="smtpsettings"/>
  </p>
  <p>
  <br>
  After above steps are performed, start your project or navigate to it.

  <h5><u>HOW DO WE USE LIGHT SCRUM</u></h5>
<br>

<b>1-Where do I start ?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Register, in order to have an account, then log in using your registration nickname and password.</li>
  <li>On Scrum Board landing page, you will see four empty columns, TODO, INPROGRESS, QA, DONE</li>
  <li>The first thing would be to create your first TODO task item.
		For that click on three vertical dots near TODO column 	 title, and click on New Item.</li>
	<li>A window apears, and the first three "must" options to select are Client, Epic, and Product Backlog. If you have not 	 created each one of them before, go ahead and create them now, in the following sequence, Client, Epic, Product 	 Backlog.</li>


<li>
This is needed to link each new task item you create to a particular client. Now since you can and will have many clients, each client can have one or many epics, and in turn each epic, can or will have one or many Product 	 	 Backlogs, and finally, each Product Backlog can have one or many Task Items, which you see on the landing page.This 	 	 connection will later ve visible when you navigate to Sprint. This is done from one side to lessen the pressure on you 	 from specifying time frame for each of your items and sprints that you create, and directly jump to work, thus increasing Hyperproductivity.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  
<b>2-Creating a Client</b>
<ul>
  <li>
	To create a new Client, click on Clients menu at the top navigation bar. Then, next to the Clients header title, there are three vertical dots. Click on them, and you will see the option New Client. Fill out the window that comes up, and save changes.
  </li>
  </ul>
<br>

<b>3-Creating an Epic</b>
<ul>
  <li>
	In order to create an Epic, we need to be on the selected Epics page that relate to particular Client.To create a new Epic, first navigate to all epics page by clicking on three vertical dots inside selected client on Clients page. You will see the menu pops up with the following options: All Epics, Create Epic, and Delete. If you want to see all epics, click on All Epics, if you want to create a new epic, click on Create Epic. A new window will show up, fill Epic title, Epic description, and Save Changes.You will then be redirected to the Epics page.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  
<b>4-Creating a Product Backlog</b>
<ul>
  <li>
	In order to create a New Product Backlog, you first must have and epic, and a client to which that particular epic belongs. So, on the Epics page, choose particular epic, click on three vertical dots in the bottom left, and you will see the menu with three options: All Product Backlogs, New Product Backlog, and Delete. Click on New Product Backlog.Fill out the window that shows up, and click on Save Shanges.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>


<b>5-Creating a task </b>
<p>
	You can create a task either from landing Scrum Board first page or from Sprint Backlog, after you move your Product Backlog to Sprint Backlog.
	To create a task from your landing page:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Click on three vertical dots near TODO column 	 title, and click on New Item.</li>
	<li>A window apears, and the first three "must" options to select are Client, Epic, and Product Backlog. If you 			have not created each one of them before, go ahead and create them now, in the following sequence, 			Client, Epic, Product 	 Backlog. Then continue to specify task details and description.</li>
</ul>
<br>
	To create a task from Scrum Board:
  <ul>
  <li>
		In the first column to the left you will see all the Product Backlogs that you moved from Sprint Planning.
Pick one Product Backlog that you want to add a task to, and click on three vertical dots to the bottom left, then click on New Sprint Item.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>6-Moving a task to QA</b>
<ul>
<li>
  On landing Scrum Board page, click on three vertical dots on the bottom left of a task, and move it to QA accordingly. If the task is in TODO, click on INPROGRESS, and then click on QA, once it is in progress.
  </li>
</ul>
  <br>
  
<b>7-Changing QA Owner </b>

<ul>
 <li>If you want to change the owner of QA. Once the task is in QA, click on three vertical dots at the bottom left, and then click on Change Owner.  A window will appear with the list of team members who are in the same team as you are. Select one member and click on Save Changes. He or she in his or her turn will see the task in his or her TODO items once they log in.
  </li>
</ul>
